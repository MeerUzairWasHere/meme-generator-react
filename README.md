# Meme-Generator

This Git repository contains the source code for a meme generator app built using React. The app allows users to create custom memes by inputting their own text for the top and bottom of the meme, and then clicking a button to generate a new meme image.


The app is designed with a simple and intuitive user interface that allows users to quickly create and share their own personalized memes. The code is organized into several React components, each responsible for a different aspect of the app's functionality.


The main features of the app include:


Two input fields for the top and bottom text of the meme.

A button to generate a new meme image using an external API.

An image preview of the generated meme.

The ability to download or share the generated meme via social media or email.

This Git repository contains all the necessary code, dependencies, and assets required to run the meme generator app. The code is fully documented and easy to customize, making it an excellent starting point for anyone looking to build a similar app using React.
